FAR HORIZONS
============

FAR HORIZONS is a strategic role-playing game of galactic exploration, trade,
diplomacy, and conquest. The first and second editions were designed for play
by postal mail. Later editions were designed for play by electronic mail. The
seventh edition rules and source code were released in 1999 by Rick Morneau.

This repository contains the original source code with various bug fixes and
improvements. There have been *no changes to the game mechanics*, and there are
no immediate plans to make any.
