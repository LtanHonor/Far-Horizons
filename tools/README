Python deps:
    - python-yaml
    - IMAPClient - http://imapclient.freshfoo.com/
    - dateutil   - http://labix.org/python-dateutil

The python utilities are designed to replace the bash scripts.

farhorizons.yml   - configure your fh games here see farhorizons.yml.sample
                    generally I would put this in the game data dir. this config file
                    is required by all the scripts below.

signups_verify.py - checks for new registrations in a google docs spreadsheet
                    and verifies that the registriation is correct (15 tech points,
                    less than 31 characters in names, etc.)

signups_fetch.py  - use after signups close. downloads registration data into a csv
                    for use with game_setup.py to create the game

game_setup.py     - replaces Auto.pl. takes the csv generated by signups_fetch.py and
                    creates the game in the data directory by calling the appropriate
                    FH executables: NewGalaxy, MakeHomes, HomeSystem, AddSpecies

game_packet.py   -  tool that creates a first turn packet (a zip file )with galaxy maps and turn report

orders_fetch.py   - replaces fhprocmail. fetches orders via imap from gmail and
                    verifies their accuracy, then sends a confirmation email.

turn_run.py       - replaces fhtest. run this in the game directory to process a turn.
                    however, it doesn't save the turn results. it places them in a
                    tmp folder so you can verify them.

turn_confirm.py   - replaces fhsave. run from the game directory. copies the
                    turn results generated with turn_run into the game directory.

turn_save.py      - replaces fhclean. saves the turn into backup/ and reports directory.

turn_end.py       - replaces fhreports. sends an email containing the turns results
                    to all players. also notifies them of the next deadline.
